My metaphoric hat rack is filled with skills for front-end engineering, design, and product management. As an engineering manager for the past four years, I've built a team devoted to design systems, component libraries, and unique tools. We make the lives of the teams we support easier and their work process faster. I create a collaborative environment, enable efficient and versatile solutions, and influence every customer-facing product from our organization.
